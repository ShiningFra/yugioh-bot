# yugioh-bot
Just for cards downloads

## Hey, want to know how to launch it ? 
 It's easier done than said !! Just clone it, next copy the content of `.env.example` into a `.env` file (create it), then replace `ton_token` by your telegram bot token, next run 
 ```cmd
 npm install
 ```

  on your cmd/terminal (opened from the cloned folder, indeed ha ha), next run 
 ```cmd
 node index.mjs
 ```

 Indeed, this won't work without a bot, so take care, bye bye 

 Fra likes playing a lot !!!
