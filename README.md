# yugioh-bot
Just for cards downloads
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Hey, want to know how to launch it ? 
 It's easier done than said !! Just clone it, next copy the content of `.env.example` into a `.env` file (create it), then replace `ton_token` by your telegram bot token, next run 
 ```cmd
 npm install
 ```

  on your cmd/terminal (opened from the cloned folder, indeed ha ha), next run 

 ```cmd
 node index.mjs
 ```
(in the case u want search by card names)

 ```cmd
 node bot.mjs
 ```
(in the case u want get All cards, 10 cards a time, with Previous and Next nav buttons)

 Indeed, this won't work without a bot, so take care, bye bye 

 Fra likes playing a lot !!!
